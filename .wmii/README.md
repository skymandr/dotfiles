This configuration script for `wmii` works for version `3.9.2`, but not for
`3.10.*`. It relies on a few help scripts that can be found in the `scripts`
folder.

While the documentation for `3.6` to `3.9` was excellent, I could never find
any up to date documentation for `3.10`. The project seems to have disappeared
from the face of the internet and is probably no longer actively developed.
Hence why I switched to `i3wm` (https://www.i3wm.org).
