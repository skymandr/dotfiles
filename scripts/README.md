Of these scripts only `kbhelp`, `blurlock` and `toggletouchpad` are currently in
use, both for my `i3wm` setup. `blurlock` was adapted from an original script by
@veikman, and `toggletouchpad` was found here:
https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3747/enabling-multimedia-keys.1.html .

The other scripts are either `i3wm` scripts that I don't use (probably from
https://github.com/bookercodes/dotfiles/tree/ubuntu/.i3/scripts).
